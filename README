ChatPlugin
==========
A chat plugin for paper 1.12.2 Minecraft servers.

Requirements
------------
You will need a JDK.

Installation
------------
For Unix/Linux:

	./gradlew build

For Windows:

	gradlew.bat build

The JAR file will be put into build/libs/

Features
--------
There are 6 commands in the plugin:

	/whisper
	/reply
	/ignore
	/ignorelist
	/kill
	/help

Players' ignore lists are saved to an ignorelist.yml file in the plugin's data
folder. When players are ignored, they won't be able to message the player
who ignored them, and their public messages will be hidden from that player.
